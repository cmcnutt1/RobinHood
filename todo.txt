To Do:
----------

Scraper:
    
    - Integrate Database

    - Once Database integrated, export all "Learn More" URLs to txt file, make LearnMoreScrape use
        those URLs to run its scrape

    - EDGE CASES:

	- Land Tours (Also fucks up Itenerary scraping) - Can be sorted out. Deal with in separate scraper


	- Sold Out <----SKIP THESE (Add boolean & if statement to determine if result should be written to database) 
		- Sold Out - (ALSO! Need to check if any certain date is sold out. i.e. "7 NIGHT SCANDINAVIA AND RUSSIA CRUISE, $1016". Check for children where "Choose Date" button should be)


	- "19 Night 19 Night" (This one is sold out, so not currently issue. But need edge case written for future)


	- Sounds (Listed as "Cruising", should be listed as port) (Also, some wonky stuff going on with text. i.e. "Milford Sound (Cruising),". Typically listed as "Milford Sound,")


	- Occasionally, there will be mispost of Cruising (Day at Sea) listed as a port. Need to weed this out so that it doesn't end up as a port. Could possibly be as simple as checking for the word "Cruising", "(CRUISING)" in each port name



Input:

    - Fucking Everything


    -EDGE CASES:
	- Different Departure and Ending locations (Need confirmation on if only certain cruise ships do point to point instead of full circle)
